# Fancy GapMinder

I'll apply knowledge of animations and joins to create a scatterplot that animates as attribute and years for the dataset are updated, which is popularly known as the GapMinder scatterplot. 

* Download a set of four data attributes from the [GapMinder Data website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) for use in my scatterplot.
* Display a scatterplot on my webpage that shows two selected attributes for a specific year for a regional set of countries (Africa, North America, etc.).
* Be able to change the year shown in the scatterplot, by (1) inputting a specific year in an HTML `input` box, or (2) by starting/stopping an animation that iterates through the years in your dataset. Whenever the year changes, use animated transitions to update the positions of items on the scatterplot.
* The user can also change the attributes shown in the scatterplot. Again, I'll use animated transitions to update the positions of items.
* The user can also switch to a different regional set of countries. Use animated joins to make the "outgoing countries" disappear and "incoming countries" appear on the scatterplot.
